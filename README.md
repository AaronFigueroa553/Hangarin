## Short Description
This Django admin interface manages various components for organizing tasks, categories, priorities, and notes. It allows users to easily add, modify, and filter categories (e.g., finance, school, work), set task priorities (e.g., critical, low), manage notes related to tasks, and handle subtasks under larger tasks. The system helps keep everything organized and searchable for efficient task management.
